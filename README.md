# Bitcoin-draw website repository
This repository contains the bitcoin lottery frontend I wrote a while ago. Please, feel free to fork and use this code for whatever reasons you want.

It is just a simple web-wrap around the server code, nothing fancy: displays the bitcoin deposit address, list of participants and a list of winners
